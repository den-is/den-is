<h1 align="center"><b>About Me</b></h1>

<p align="center"><b>Senior DevOps engineer and automation expert</b></p>

I'm a senior DevOps engineer with almost 20 years of experience in the field. I started my journey a long time ago as a networks and systems administrator in the early 2000s.

My primary focus is architecting and supporting Kubernetes environments in an efficient and durable manner, either on-premises, in zero-trust environments, or on clouds.

My favorite cloud provider is AWS, but of course, years of experience have required me to work within different environments and cloud providers.

I'm an adherent of full automation principles and the usage of GitOps, IaC, or any other configuration automation techniques.

I love coding in Go and Python.
